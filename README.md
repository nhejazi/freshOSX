# Mac OS X customization
## Fresh Installs (using Homebrew)

My set of customization scripts for setting Mac OS X to my preferences.

**Directions/Roadmap**

1. install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html), [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/downloading.html), [FB Messenger](http://fbmacmessenger.rsms.me/) manually.
2. `sh 1_genBrew.sh`
3. `sh ___.sh`
4. 


to be made into a set of scripts in the (ideally, near) future...
